## Description
This project is a simple interest calculator that calculates the interest earned on a principal amount over a period of time using a fixed interest rate.

## Formula
Simple Interest is calculated using the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## Inputs
- Principal amount
- Interest rate (percentage)
- Time (in years)

## Output
